<h2>What's wrong?</h2>
<p>The voting rate of students at UVM is below the national average by 3%. That might not seem problematic except for the fact it means only 46.2% of our campus voted in the last general election.</p>

<p>We can fix this.</p>

<h2>Two steps. Right now.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Register people to vote.</li>
    <li>Encourage folks to turn out at the polls.</li>
</ol>
<p>This semester, we're aiming to increase turnout through using a campaign style approach. Specifically, it looks like relying on personal relationships and incremental support to being people the resources they need to not only register but also vote, come election day.</p>

<h2>The Greater Vision</h2>
<p>Institutionalize voting.

Presently, UVM has a handful of useful voting resources, but they're not incorperated to the main paths students travel, physically or digitally. Solving for this,registration and other voting resources should be integrated with the course registration portal. Stanford, James Madison University, and others across the country have already deployed models like this to increase turnout.

The most encouraging version of these course registration hold models is to give students the most flexibility while putting resources in front of them. By leveraging a system which every university student has contact with, voter registration and the visibility for the importance of voting will increase.

UVM has already partnered with TurboVote - a great tool to support voter registration - but tools kept in the back of a shed aren't likely to see much action.</p>
