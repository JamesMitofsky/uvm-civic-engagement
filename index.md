<h2>The issue.</h2>
<p>Compared with other universities around the country, our voting rate is down. Not to mention that college students in general are one of the less well represented demographics, which compounds with issues of socio-economic status. According to the <a href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve">National Study of Learning, Voting, and Education</a>, less than half of UVM's undergraduate students voted in the last general election.</p>

<p class="bold">We can fix this.</p>

<h2>Two steps. Right now.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Register people to vote.</li>
    <li>Encourage folks to turn out at the polls.</li>
</ol>
<p>This semester, we're aiming to increase turnout through using a campaign style approach. Specifically, it looks like relying on personal relationships and incremental support to being people the resources they need to not only register but also vote, come election day.</p>

<h2>The Greater Vision</h2>
<p>Institutionalize voting.

UVM aleady has a handful of useful voting resources, but they're off the beaten path - digitall or otherwise. Solving for this, the administration should integrate voting the mainstream student experience. In person, this could be through orientation or move-in days. Or, why not follow in the footsteps of Stanford and Northwester, affording students a step in their online registrtion process to consider their voting resources?

Through harmonizing the university's pre-exiting processes with registering students to vote, there's good reason to suspect this small change would pay off in dividends of significantly increased voter turnout. In some ways, going to school is about making certain decisions easier, like studying for French exams, chem finals, anthro projects, or even - incredibly - voting.

Having partnered with TurboVote, UVM has already laid some of the groundwork for students to tread toward online resources. The hurdle of moving the existing civic groundwork into the limelight is a barrier worth crossing.</p>
