<h2>The issue.</h2>
<p>Compared with other universities around the country, our voting rate is down. Not to mention that college students in general are one of the less well represented demographics, which compounds with issues of socio-economic status. According to the <a href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve" target="_blank">National Study of Learning, Voting, and Education</a>, less than half of UVM's undergraduate students voted in the last general election.</p>

<p class="bold">We can fix this.</p>

<h2>Two steps. Right now.</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Give people the resources to register.</li>
    <li>Encourage those people to vote.</li>
</ol>
<p>This semester, we're aiming to increase turnout through using a campaign style approach. This looks like relying on personal relationships and incremental support to bring folks the resources they need to both register and vote. This includes live problem solving and - since 80% of our student population is out-of-state - considering where competative races are happening.</p>
<p>The impact of this project benefits greatly from more participation across graduation years and, especially, majors.</p>

<h2>The Greater Vision</h2>
<p>Institutionalize voting.

UVM aleady has a handful of useful voting resources, but they're off the beaten path - digitall or otherwise. Solving for this, the administration should integrate voting the mainstream student experience. In person, this could be through orientation or move-in days. Or, why not follow in the footsteps of Stanford and Northwester, affording students a step in their online registrtion process to consider their voting resources?

Through harmonizing the university's pre-exiting processes with registering students to vote, there's good reason to suspect this small change would pay off in significantly increased voter turnout. It has to be said that the university is uniquely positioned to help solve this problem. That's because, in some ways, going to school is about making the good decisions easier, like studying for French exams, chem finals, and anthro projects. It's not hard to imagine including voter registration.

Having already partnered with TurboVote, UVM has laid some of the groundwork for students to tread toward online resources. The hurdle of moving the existing civic groundwork into the limelight is a barrier worth crossing.</p>
