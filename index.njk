        <h2 class="title">The issue.</h2>
        <p>Compared with other universities around the country, our voting rate is down. Not to mention that college students in general are one of the less well represented demographics, which compounds with issues of socio-economic status. According to the
            <a class="link" href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve" target="_blank">National Study of Learning, Voting, and Education</a>, less than half of UVM's undergraduate students voted in the last general election.</p>

        <p class="bold">We can fix this.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Our Solution</h2>
        <p>Through peer-to-peer contact over the course of three sessions between mid-September and election day, we'll increase voter turnout. This helps us break up the work of making sure people are registered, know where their polling place is (or have a mail-in ballot), and remember to turnout on election day.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The Greater Vision</h2>
    <p>Institutionalize voting.</p>

    <p>UVM aleady has a handful of
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.uvm.edu/studentlife/ce/voters">voting resources</a>, but they're off the beaten path (physically and digitally). Solving for this, the administration should integrate voting the mainstream student experience. In person, this could be through orientation or move-in days. Or, why not follow in the footsteps of Stanford and Northwestern, affording students a step in their online registrtion process to consider their voting resources?</p>

    <p>Through harmonizing the university's pre-exiting processes with registering students to vote, there's good reason to suspect this small change would pay off in significantly increased voter turnout. It has to be said that the university is uniquely positioned to help solve this problem. That's because, in some ways, going to school is about making the good decisions easier, like studying for French exams, chem finals, and anthro projects. It's not hard to imagine including voter registration. Having already partnered with TurboVote, UVM has laid some of the groundwork for students, but placing those resources front and center is where impactful change can be found.</p>
