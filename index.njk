        <h2 class="title">The issue.</h2>
        <p>Compared with other universities around the country, our voting rate is down. Not to mention that college students in general are one of the less well represented demographics, which compounds with issues of socio-economic status. According to the
            <a class="link" href="https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve" target="_blank">National Study of Learning, Voting, and Education</a>, less than half of UVM's undergraduate students voted in the last general election.</p>

        <p class="bold">We can fix this.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Our Solution</h2>
        <p>Through peer-to-peer contact over the course of three sessions between mid-September and election day, we'll increase voter turnout. This helps us break up the work of making sure people are registered, know where their polling place is (or have a mail-in ballot), and remember to turnout on election day.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The Greater Vision</h2>
    <p>Institutionalize voting.</p>

    <p>UVM aleady has a handful of voting resources, but they're off the beaten path. We could move these resources into the mainstream a few ways. In the physical sense, that might look like registering voters during orientation days, while in the digital sense, it could look like a featuring of resources in the My UVM portal. Stanford even
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/02/06/new-enrollment-hold-encourages-students-to-register-to-vote/">rolled out a system</a>
        where registering to vote is a registration-hold until you explicitly register or opt-out.</p>

    <p>It's easy to imagine how UVM supporting student voters as a core value would increase turnout.</p>
