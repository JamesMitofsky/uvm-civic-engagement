        <h2 class="title" data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="zoom-out" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">The issue.</h2>
        <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">Compared with other universities around the country, our voting rate is down. This on top of the fact that the underrepresentation of college students is experienced widely across the country, not to mention how that compounds with issues of socio-economic status. According to
            <a class="link" href="assets/General-Election-NSLVE-Data.pdf" target="_blank">our campus report</a>
            from the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Education, less than half of UVM's undergraduate students voted in the last general election.</p>

        <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back" class="bold">We can fix this.</p>

        <h2 class="title" data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="zoom-out" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">Our Solution</h2>
        <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">Students helping students is a great way to solve relatable problems. Through texting other students over the course of three meetings between mid-September and election day, we'll increase voter turnout. Since each of these meetings is only 1-2 hours long, our workload is kept light (for both the people sending and receiving info). Using this strategy, it's suddenly not so intimidating to help students figure out if they're registered, how to mail in their ballot, whether to vote in or out of state, and remembering to turnout on election day.</p>
        <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">The two roles are pretty similar in the end, but organizers put in a little extra time recruiting other students and considering how best to further develop our work.</p>

    <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">UVM has a handful of voting resources, but they're off the beaten path. We could move these resources into the mainstream a few ways. In the physical sense, that might look like registering voters during orientation days, while in the digital sense, it could look like a featuring of resources in the myUVM portal. Stanford has already
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/02/06/new-enrollment-hold-encourages-students-to-register-to-vote/">rolled out a system</a>
        where registering to vote is a class-registration hold until you explicitly acknowledge you've considered registering.</p>

    <p data-sal-repeat="data-sal-repeat" data-sal="slide-right" data-sal-duration="1000" data-sal-easing="ease-out-back">It's easy to imagine how UVM supporting student voters as a core value would increase turnout.</p>
