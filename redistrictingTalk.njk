<p><em>
        Join us for cider and donuts on
        Middlebury's beautiful campus while we
        learn

<p>With the arrival of 2020 Census data, voting
    districts are being redrawn — a process which
    largely determines who gets elected to office.
    Experts from around Vermont will be
    discussing the national and local implications
    of this process, as well as the critical roll
    of young people.
