title: Comparing Notes with Stanford Votes
author: James Tedesco

## Club Visibility

* Stanford Votes has embraced branding as an important way of getting in touch with students, making concious efforts to be seen and heard. For example, rather than implementing a course registration hold (requiring student to consider their voter registration status) on their own, they implicated their student government by getting its endorsement.
* For specific marketing campaigns to the student body, they relied on business majors, pushed pizza parties, and improved their web presence.
* Build connections with faculty, asking American Political System professors for advice, for example. This reminds me of the importance of developing a presence amongst STEM professors, since they're the most direct inroad to the demographic with such low participation.

## Making Change

* Access the broader campus community (RAs & Profs).
* Have a name attached to all university promoted material as a single point of contact to help confused students.
* Break up email groups between general and organizing interests (i.e. bat signal).
* Optional voting day via the faculty senate, which sets the university calendar.

  * Bring it from the student government, and maybe even intercepting the graduate student senate in between. Glob on more vested actors.

## In vs. Out of State Students

Two-thirds of their student population is out-of-state, much like UVM's. This creates a unique information challenge where students are voting through many varied systems with likewise varying student-voter friendliness.

Chase recommended reading Green & Gerber's, "[Get Out the Vote](https://www.brookings.edu/book/get-out-the-vote-2/)," on the efficacy of voter mobilization strategies.
