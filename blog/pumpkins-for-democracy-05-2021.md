4th this year, UVM Votes hosted an event to help spread voter registration QR
codes around campus. And what better way to distribute these codes than on top

With a grant from National Voter Registration Day, we were able to bring this event into reality. Here's a peak at one of my drafts of the impact we'd have on campus:

Before we can wow any students though, we needed to do the hard work of cutting some gord and scooping some guts. Armed with 20 pumpkins, a few cutting implements, and some personal grit, we got to work.
