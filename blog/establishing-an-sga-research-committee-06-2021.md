## We Have a Problem

Our SGA has a problem: very few students are voting to elect campus leaders, and the qualified students who are elected often resign after one term. These problems aren't unique to UVM, but that doesn't make them any less material.

Seeking to address this — among other things — the current SGA President, Sam Pasqualoni, and UVM Votes President, James Tedesco, are founding an ad-hoc research committee to understand how other schools have attempted to handle these same problems.

## The Committee’s Work

**Only 17.3% of catamounts voted in last year’s SGA election (see [Engagement 3.3](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Office-of-the-Provost/ASG_Dashboard_Oct4_2020.pdf)). How can we raise that?**

Plenty of schools around the country suffer from this same problem of low participation, and it’s this committee’s objective to research what is and isn’t working for SGAs at other schools. Bringing speakers for internal development among senators is important, but internal ideation and external research are complimentary, not supplementary. Each has their place.

**There’s a pattern of senator burnout, where qualified candidates don’t run for re-election. How do we retain them?**

This could be explained by high achieving students having to prioritize their activities as they near graduation, but it begs the question: why isn't SGA viewed as a valuable opportunity for continued growth and resume building?

## Why Bother?

**Low voter participation in any system creates a "legitimacy deficit,"** where the elected body isn’t *actually* representative of whom it claims to represent. By increasing the student participation in SGA elections, we increase the organization’s legitimacy as being representative of UVM students. This leads to two important outcomes:

1. Declarations are taken more seriously. For example, giving a proposal to the administration would signal “the students of UVM want this,” rather than the current model (which, granted, is sometimes in tune with the student body) that signals “the SGA wants this”. The more students the SGA can speak for, the more powerful its actions are.
2. Elections would become more competitive, promoting the likelihood the most qualified candidates will make it on to the ballot. This comes with a big asterisk around how privilege takes shape and effects who is able to devote the most time to campaigning,  but solving for that problem is not mutually exclusive to the work of this committee. The first step is to get more students voting.
