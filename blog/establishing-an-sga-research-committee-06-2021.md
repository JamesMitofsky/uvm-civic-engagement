## The Structural Problem

Very few students are voting in SGA elections to elect campus leaders, and it's common for the most qualified students to resign after one term. This amount of turnover in the college environment makes coalition building difficult.

## Solving a Nation-Wide Question

It's not uncommon for Student Government Associations (SGAs) around the country to face such problems, but as a school with no shortage of student activism, the University of Vermont can answer this long-unaddressed question.

The SGA and UVM Votes are partnering to form a research committee which will complete a comparative analysis of student governments around the country, culminating in a brief presented to the SGA with recommended changes.

## The Committee’s Work

The committee is specifically geared toward comparing how SGAs at other institutions stack up against each other — this approach of "checking each other's homework" lets us use other universities as laboratories of democracy.

Our two questions:

1. How to increase voter participation in SGA elections and campaigns?
2. How to retain incumbent senators?

   1. This could be explained by high achieving students having to prioritize their activities as they near graduation, but it begs the question: why isn't SGA viewed as a valuable opportunity for continued growth and resume building?

## Why Bother?

**Low voter participation in any system creates a "legitimacy deficit,"** where the elected body isn’t *actually* representative of whom it claims to represent. Only 17.3% of catamounts voted in last year’s SGA election (see [Engagement 3.3](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Office-of-the-Provost/ASG_Dashboard_Oct4_2020.pdf)). By increasing the student participation in SGA elections, we increase the organization’s legitimacy as being representative of UVM students. This leads to two important outcomes:

1. Declarations are taken more seriously. For example, giving a proposal to the administration would signal “the students of UVM want this,” rather than the current model (which, granted, is sometimes in tune with the student body) that signals “the SGA wants this”. The more students the SGA can speak for, the more powerful its actions are.
2. Elections would become more competitive, promoting the likelihood the most qualified candidates will make it on to the ballot. This comes with a big asterisk around how privilege takes shape and effects who is able to devote the most time to campaigning,  but solving for that problem is not mutually exclusive to the work of this committee. The first step is to get more students voting.
