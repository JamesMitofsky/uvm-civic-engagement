If yield was held constant, this is how much an
increase in registration would affect the system:

This is another way of thinking about where to
invest your time when getting out the vote.

While registering new voters and helping currently
registered students turn
out to the polls are by no means mutually
exclusive, it's important to time your efforts for
the most impact. Early on in the year is a great
time to be doing voter registration drives, but
when the election is on your doorstep, it should
be a full tilt effort to make sure students have a
plan to vote.

<b>Formula & Explanation</b>
<code>Year 1 to Year 2 VR Change = (RR Delta *
    YR Delta) + (RR Delta * Year 1 YR) + (YR Delta
    * Year 1 RR)
</code>
<p>The equations used here were derived from the
    above formula. When testing for yield changes,
    the registration delta was held at zero, and
    likewise, when testing for the impact of
    registration changes, the yield delta was held
    at zero. This canceled out that part of the
    formula, allowing for the simplified equations
    found in the calculator.</p>
