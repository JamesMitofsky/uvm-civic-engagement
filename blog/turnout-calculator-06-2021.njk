If yield was held constant, this is how much an
increase in registration would affect the system:
<form>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Impact Caculator (2016 baseline)
        </legend>
        <span>Compare registering
            eligible voters
            and turning out already registered
            ones. Measure impact by a percent
            change of</span>
        <input placeholder="%" id="regDelta"
            type="number">
        <h3>Registering Voters</h3><span>A change
            of</span>
        <span
            class="userInput">____</span><span>will
            have a</span>
        <span
            id="regChange">______</span><span>impact
            on the overall voter pool.</span>

        <h3>Turning Out the Vote</h3><span>A
            change
            of</span>
        <span class="userInput">____</span>will
        have a
        <span
            id="yieldChange">______</span><span>impact
            on the overall voter pool.</span>
    </fieldset>
</form>

This is another way of thinking about where to
invest your time when getting out the vote.

While registering new voters and helping currently
registered students turn
out to the polls are by no means mutually
exclusive, it's important to time your efforts for
the most impact. Early on in the year is a great
time to be doing voter registration drives, but
when the election is on your doorstep, it should
be a full tilt effort to make sure students have a
plan to vote.
