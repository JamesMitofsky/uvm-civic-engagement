**Article 6: Meeting and Quorum**



1. Occurrence of Meetings
    1. Meetings are weekly on Monday 8:00pm—8:30pm during the regular semester period.
    2. The Executive Board may convene afterward if there’s unfinished business which requires a more focused discussion, but all possible business should be conducted in the general meeting.
2. Special Meetings
    3. The calling of an unscheduled meeting is unlikely, but may be done in response to breaking news.
3. Quorum
    4. At least 10 members present including Executive Board members (since they are members foremost).
    5. A simple majority (> 50%)
4. Voting
    6. Discussion will always be held before a vote. If there is a need to impose a speaking limit, it will be imposed within the first three speakers to prevent unfairly advantaging too many members.
    7. For the passage of a vote, a simple majority is required; a plurality is insufficient.
        1. If the item being voted on doesn’t receive more than 50% of the vote, additional rounds of voting shall be held until the condition is met.
        2. Discussion will be allowed after every round when another round will be required.
