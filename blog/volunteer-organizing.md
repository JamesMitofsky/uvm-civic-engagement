# 5 Rules to Organize Volunteers

When you’re starting a volunteer group, playing a leadership role can be hard to finesse.

Nothing will replace a brazen willingness to investigate options yourself, but this guide should help frame your thinking. These rules are lessons learned through my organizing work with UVM Votes.

## #1: Be excited!
Enthusiasm (from the right place) is often more valuable than knowledge. It’s hard to be the smartest person in the room, but to be even in the running for friendliest is welcome competition.

Compared to explaining your work clinically, it’s much easier to get people to sign-on when they feel the buzz of your excitement. Topics that we don’t know much about are difficult to appreciate without someone animating them. Think amusement park vs. its brochure.

Be the amusement park.

## #2: Be brief.
Make the way you communicate show you value people’s time. This begins with being authentic but brief. Leave space for people to ask questions.

When you eventually build an email list, write mass emails **sparingly** and use **information hierarchy**.

**Sparingly**: I send an email right before and after big events. The first email reminds folks of what we hope to do, what they have to gain, and finally how they can get involved further. The second email thanks everyone for their participation and alludes to any future events.

**Information hierarchy**: this means to give your text varied emphasis according to its importance. For example, headers are bolded, larger, and have wider margins. Meanwhile, body text can still benefit from bold and italics, but through being smaller, the reader knows to discount the contents of the body text as less important than the header.

Expect your dear reader to skim.

## #3: Build bridges.
Meet with anyone who will give you the time. Reach out to other organizations like yours, government officials, or local businesses. They’ve been around the block and are well positioned to share advice or collaborate. Even those meetings which don’t result in concrete work have some peripheral benefits:

* Get a flavor for the voice behind emails or texts.
* Put yourself on people’s radar for the future.
* Learn of other people or groups you should speak with.

Where possible, though, try to collaborate on specific goals with other groups! When other groups bring their existing volunteer base to your projects, it helps to stabilize your work since their turnout and numbers are likely to be more consistent. This lessens your workload for coordinating since you can lean on the other group’s leadership as a liaison.

All this cooperation makes it easier for new people to find your project and get involved.

## #4: Beware ego.
Excitement has an ugly cousin: ego. Try to avoid eccentric language or titles; they stand in the way of your message and tend to make your work sound more complicated than important. Pomp & circumstance are the cardinal sins of organizing; choose servant leadership instead.

Introduce yourself as an organizer with the group rather than its leader. Not only does this keep titles out of the mix, but it emphasizes an organizational structure designed to endure leadership turnover and is therefore bigger than any one person involved.

Don’t let frills distract from your work.

## #5: Select a goal.
Choose one project that’ll receive your attention and create clear action-steps for that target. Many projects can become an embarrassment of riches, just too difficult to juggle! Although a list of projects is great for future planning (and helping solidify your mission statement), it’s important to know their priority and timeline. Some will take weeks, others might take years.

Aside from being hard to coordinate, running two concurrent can also muddy your messaging. By spreading yourself thin, it becomes hard to capture the essence of your work succinctly which can fracture recruitment and organizing efforts.

Make your goal and action-steps clear.

### Honorary mention.
Finally, the honorary mention goes to websites! It didn’t make the list since it’s more resource than organizing tactic, but a good website serves as a source of truth for your group: the problem you care about, how you’re solving it now, and what you’d like to do in the future.

Most importantly though, it gives people an easy way to subscribe to your email list — this is critical.

Choose a good URL (eg. uvm.vote) and send that link to every friend, group, or leader you talk to.
