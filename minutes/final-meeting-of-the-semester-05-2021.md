## House Keeping

### SGA Funding

Brian reported his meeting with the Treasurer has been delayed to this coming Friday. We’ll likely have our hands on the funds then.

## Discussion

### Why Not Make Voting Hard?

- It’s absurd to suggest that we gain ‘quality votes’ by making it harder when there’s the law of large numbers: making small things easier have long term implications
- Voters have jobs, sometimes more than one. If time is money, then forcing people to add time is functionally a poll tax.
- If people are already having trouble engaging with political subjects, going out to vote
- Party distinction between explicit and implicit (right and left). The liberal wing of the party system is very concerned with the implications of how voting laws say things.
- The tough love strategy has no definitive end.

## Member Updates
