## Increase meeting attendance: Become omni-present


* Hold ice cream walks/runs to give people a place outside of boring Zoom meetings.

* Advertise group by asking professors of intro political science classes if we can present. Likewise with Hcol classes, especially plenary.

* Work with Civic Engagement Office.

* See if a blackboard post can exist on the main student sign-in page.

* Mia Dillon & Sophie Feldman can post in student Facebook groups for '23 and '24 graduation years.

* Take advantage of other groups/clubs with pre-existing base; advertise to their membership by working with their leadership.


## Voter registration as community service


* Can voter registration qualify as community service for fraternities and sororities?

  * Check in with Vega (Director of FSL) about this.
