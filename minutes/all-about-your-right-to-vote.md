title: All About Your Right to Vote
description: >-
  ## Your Right to Vote: 


  * You can’t withhold someone the right to vote 

    * Well, you can for silly administrative things 

      * BUT! You can’t single out groups of people 
  * You can’t ask questions to specific groups 

  * You cannot ask for information that identifies something specifically about that person’s demographic (unless it is a pertinent goal of the state)  

  * States are empowered to make a lot of their own suffrage rights decisions about voting

  * For many students this leads to…

    * Lots of implications about tricky voting 
    * Not a lot of outright “you can’t vote” 
  * HAVA

    * Net harm for voting rights
    * Done in response to Bush-Gore election

  ## Why We Can’t Have Ballot Boxes on Campus: 


  * Would have to be passed through a bill at the state legislator level 

  * Would need to be secure

    * Bolted to the floor 
    * Live internet connected video feed
    * Needs to be collected daily 
  * May revisit in 1-2 years 


  ## Polling Place on Campus: 


  * Must be neutral 

  * Fletcher free is not that far from campus 


  ## Voting Calendar: 


  * Vote 411

  * Problem: doesn’t go very far into the future

    * Best research for elections (such as candidate platforms) usually occurs in the few weeks before hand  
  * Can we link this to our site? 


  ## Voting Out Of State: 


  * Add a module for resources on the website 

  * Should we focus on an instate path? 


  ## UVM Votes Podcast: 


  * How can we add to this? 

  * Case studies? 

  * On the back burner for now 


  ## SGA Committee: 


  * Comparative analysis of student governments around the country 

  * One member from UVM Votes 

  * One member will be a paid intern AND get credit 


  ## Fliers: 


  * Fliers with incorrect dates are still all around campus 

  * Do we take these down?
