title: SGA funding, position updates, & club continuity
description: >-
  ## Changes in Executive Board Composition


  * Liz Chadwick resigned from Social Media position.

  * Executive Board unanimously passed replacement of Social Media position with Engagement. This was done to emphasize a focus on recruitment and engagement efforts as a strategy rather than any specialty in modes of outreach, such as social media or graphic design. Members can contribute in those ways, but they'll be supervised by the Engagement Chair.

  * Welcomed Sophie Feldman as Engagement Chair.


  ## Club Finance (reported by Treasurer Donahue)


  * UVM Votes became an SGA recognized club too late in the year to submit a finance request for the following year. This means we'll have to rely on "supplemental funding requests" until the next fiscal cycle.

  * The SGA club finance committee appropriated $325 for posters, printing, and a Canva subscription. We may throw some of this funding at a Constant Contact subscription to create better email content.


  ## General Discussion


  ### Unanimously passed


  * Eliminate the Executive Board meeting on Sundays, shifting focus to the general, public facing meeting.

  * Move the public general meeting from Tuesday at 8:30pm to Monday at 8:00pm. This gives the general meetings more drive, creating meaningful openings for new students to get involved with ongoing projects, rather than being the exclusively presentational content of past meetings.


  ### Idea from Brian


  * Have a calendar detailing election deadlines for Vermont or other states which many students from UVM hail from (see Office of Institutional Research data). Have toggles for federal and state levels.

  * Find out if this exists before reinventing the wheel.


  ### Continuity Objectives: ensure UVM Votes is infrastructurally stable.


  * Recurring meetings

    * Office of Civic Engagement
    * Director of Institutional Research (Alex Yin)
  * Voting Summit, where all student affinity clubs get together once a year to talk about voter turnout and brainstorm collaboration. What do they need? What can they do?


  ## ToDo's


  * Propose specifics to Registrar's Office for texting students about voting.

  * Send meeting invite to Office of Civic Engagement for recurring meetings held on twice monthly basis.
