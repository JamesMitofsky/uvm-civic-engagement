## Announce First General Meeting

Set the meeting for 8:30pm—9:00pm on Tuesdays (beginning 3/9/21). The SGA usually convenes from 7:00pm—8:00pm, so ideally we'd avoid a conflict so any SGA members could also attend our meeting if they wanted.

## Registration Portal Editorial

Draft an editorial making the case for [integrating voter registration into UVM's course registration portal](https://www.uvm.vote/registrar-proposal.pdf) the same way Stanford and Harvard have.

Collect the signatures of:

- COLCA

- Civic Engagement

- Thomas Sullivan

## Use RAs as Voter Reg Advocates

Have RAs share the link to TurboVote during their community circles.

## UVM Votes FAQ

Should we write a basic FAQ page for student voters at UVM and post it on our site? This could also help SEO since we might be used as a source of fact in Google results.
